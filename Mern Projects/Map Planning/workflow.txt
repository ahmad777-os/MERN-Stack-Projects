1. Define Your Problem & Scope Clearly
Write down exactly what inputs your model will get (e.g., plot size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, etc.)

Decide what output it should produce (e.g., a simple 2D layout grid, cost estimate, timeline)

Start small: maybe first focus on just generating a simple room layout before jumping to detailed floor plans or budget estimates.

2. Create or Collect Your Dataset
This is the most important and first big thing to create:

Floor plan data:

Start by sketching simple floor plans yourself or collecting existing ones.

Represent floor plans as grids or simplified images with room types (bedroom, kitchen, etc.).

Input-output pairs:

For each floor plan, note the input features:

Total plot size

Number of rooms (bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.)

And the corresponding output: floor plan layout, cost, timeline.

Cost and time data:

If you donâ€™t have real data, estimate based on your research or rules (e.g., cost per square foot).

3. Preprocess Your Data
Convert your floor plans into a consistent format. For example:

A 2D matrix/grid where each cell has a code for room type (e.g., 0 = empty, 1 = bedroom, 2 = bathroom).

Normalize numerical inputs (plot size, room counts) so they are scaled well.

Format your inputs as vectors, outputs as grids/images.

4. Build a Simple Model Prototype
Start with a simple neural network or basic generative model:

Input: Vector of features (plot size, room counts)

Output: 2D grid layout of rooms

You can implement this in Python using PyTorch or TensorFlow.

5. Train Your Model on Your Dataset
Use your dataset to train this model.

Evaluate how well it generates layouts that respect input constraints.

6. Create Additional Models for Cost and Time
After you have floor plan generation working, build a regression model that predicts:

Estimated budget (based on floor plan features)

Construction time

7. Build a Simple User Interface
Optional at first, but you can build a command-line interface or a simple web form where users input their requirements and get results.
